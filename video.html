	<p>I recorded a series of videos for James Manuele of the Portland Guitar Duo. As far as the production went, I did all of it by myself. I tracked the audio on set, straight into Apple's Logic Pro using a pair of AKG C414b's, and captured the video using a Canon Rebel T2i. I edited all of it together using Adobe Premiere and did any additional audio editing back in Logic Pro. The audio is not the greatest in this series, but that is because the restaurant that we shot it in had multiple freezers that were had to be running loudly. </p>

	<p>This was my portion of the 3D Animation that my workgroup made for <a href="https://www.omsi.edu/" target="_blank">OMSI's planetarium</a>. I created this using Autodesk's Maya 3D rendering software, and created the sounds using Apple's Logic Pro.

	<p>Sound Score Untitled #1 was a soundtrack that I created for Josh Turner's short experimental video. The video utilizes original sounds that I either recorded or synthesized using Native Instruments FM8, Massive, and Reaktor. Recorded sounds were captured using a Zoom H4n handheld recorder, and were modified and/or arranged in Apple's Logic Pro.<p>

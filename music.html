	<h3>Sun Kill Moon (2014)</h3>
	<p>Sun Kill Moon is an album that is currently in production. I recorded all the songs in my personal studio and am in the process of mixing them before sending them out to get mastered. I created the album art work using photos that I took while traveling the west coast of the United States.</p>

	<h3>An Open Mouth Hears No Words (2011)</h3>
	<p>An Open Mouth Hears No Words is an EP by the band How to Build a Fire. It was recorded by Patrick Tetreault at Ripcord Studio in Vancouver, Washington. I helped give creative input for both the musical compositions and the recording sessions. The album art work was done by Melissa Kearns, with help and guidance from both Jesus Diaz and myself. The musicians on this release include Jordan Dobbels (Singer and Guitar), Jesus Diaz (Lead Guitar), Joel Sinbauer (Drums), and myself (Bass and Piano)<p>
	<p>I had many roles with this release including creative input and marketing decisions. I had to copyright the album, market it, create the band website, and release press releases for this album. Musically, I had to come up with compositions for the Bass and Piano, as well as provide consultation for the guitarists and drummer. An Open Mouth Hears No Words was a great learning experience that taught me a lot about the business of music.</p>

	<p>Sound Score Untitled #1 was a soundtrack that I created for Josh Turner's short experimental video. The video utilizes original sounds that I either recorded or synthesized using Native Instruments FM8, Massive, and Reaktor. Recorded sounds were captured using a Zoom H4n handheld recorder, and were modified and/or arranged in Apple's Logic Pro.<p>

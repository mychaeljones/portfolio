	<h3>PDX Guitar Duo (2011)</h3>
	<p>I was asked to create a website for the Portland Guitar Duo. They were lacking some key graphical components, so I designed them a logo based around an acoustic guitar. They liked the logo so much that it is now a part of their branding. I created this logo using Adobe Photoshop, which I understand is not the best practice, but sometimes it gets the job done.</p>
	<p>Check out their logo and their site at <a href="http://www.pdxguitarduo.com" target="_blank">www.PDXGuitarDuo.com.</a>

	<h3>How to Build a Fire (2014)</h3>
	<p>I created the album art for <cite>Sun Kill Moon,</cite> the upcoming How to Build a Fire album. It is composed of 4 different photos that I took while I was traveling the west coast of the United States.</p>
	<p>More information on the upcoming album and on the band How to Build a Fire can be found at <a href="http://www.h2baf.com" target="_blank">www.H2BAF.com</a>.</p>

	<h3>Portland Guitar Duo Recordings 1999 - 2007 (2011)</h3>
	<p>The Portland Guitar Duo asked me to design the cover and insert art for their <cite>Recording 1999 - 2007</cite> album. I created all the art work (besides the photographs) using a mix of Adobe Photoshop, inDesign, and Illustrator. I edited photos in Photoshop, created vector graphics in Illustrator, and used inDesign to layout the all the content before pushing the final product off to the publishing house.</p>
	<p>You can find the release on iTunes, Amazon, and CD Baby - <a href="http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/portlandguitarduo" target="_blank">http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/portlandguitarduo</a>.</p>

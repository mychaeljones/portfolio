	<h3>PDX Guitar Duo (2011)</h3>
	<p>The PDX Guitar Duo asked me to create a website that they could easily update and maintain. I chose to create a website using WordPress, which is a blogging platform that has slowly turned into a content management system that is easy to use for non-technical users. This site uses some custom coding, including both JavaScript and PHP, as well as some custom MySQL database manipulation for handling performance dates.</p>
